# TableToTable

Our project entails our nonprofit organization, TableToTable, which is dedicated to reducing food waste and fighting hunger in our community. Our mission is to connect restaurants with surplus food to local food pantries and soup kitchens. By doing so, we help ensure that excess food is redistributed to those in need, promoting sustainability and supporting the well-being of our community.
